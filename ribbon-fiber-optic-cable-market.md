<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ribbon Fiber Optic Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode</li><li>Multi- Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ribbon fiber optic cable market is categorized into two main types: single-mode and multi-mode fibers. Single-mode cables feature a small core diameter, allowing only one light mode to propagate, which results in higher bandwidth and longer transmission distances, making them ideal for telecommunication and long-range applications. In contrast, multi-mode cables have a larger core diameter, enabling multiple light modes to travel simultaneously, suitable for shorter distances and high-speed data centers. Each type serves specific networking needs effectively.</p></p>
