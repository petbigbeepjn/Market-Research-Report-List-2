<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atherectomy Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Directional Atherectomy</li><li>Orbital Atherectomy</li><li>Photo-Ablative (Laser) Atherectomy</li><li>Rotational Atherectomy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Atherectomy systems are devices used to remove atherosclerotic plaque from blood vessels, enhancing blood flow. Directional atherectomy employs a catheter with a blade to mill away plaque in a precise direction. Orbital atherectomy utilizes a spinning tool that flails plaque, effectively treating complex lesions. Photo-ablative (laser) atherectomy uses focused laser energy to vaporize plaque, providing a minimally invasive option. Rotational atherectomy involves a high-speed rotating burr to grind away plaque, enabling safer interventions in narrowed arteries.</p></p>
