<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HIV-1 Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Antibody</li><li>Nucleic Acid Testing</li><li>Antigen</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The HIV-1 testing market comprises three primary types: antibody tests, nucleic acid tests (NAT), and antigen tests. Antibody tests detect the immune response to HIV, often used for initial screening due to their cost-effectiveness. Nucleic acid tests identify the virus's genetic material, allowing for early detection and accurate diagnosis. Antigen tests detect specific viral proteins and can reveal HIV infection sooner than antibody tests, making them crucial for timely intervention. Each type plays a vital role in monitoring and managing HIV.</p></p>
