<p><h1>Drug-Eluting Balloons Market Insights, Market Players and Forecast Till 2032</h1></p><p><strong>Drug-Eluting Balloons Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Drug-Eluting Balloons (DEBs) are specialized medical devices used in various vascular procedures to treat narrowed arteries. These balloons are coated with therapeutic agents that elute (release) drugs into the arterial wall during inflation, significantly reducing the risk of restenosis (re-narrowing of the artery) compared to traditional angioplasty balloons. DEBs are primarily utilized in the treatment of peripheral artery disease and coronary artery disease.</p><p>The Drug-Eluting Balloons Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.1% during the forecast period, driven by increasing incidences of cardiovascular diseases and the rising prevalence of diabetes and obesity. Technological advancements in balloon design and drug formulation are enhancing effectiveness and safety, contributing to market expansion. Additionally, the growing preference for minimally invasive procedures is boosting demand for DEBs.</p><p>Recent trends in the market include the development of combination therapies and biodegradable balloons, which are gaining traction due to their potential for improved patient outcomes. Regulatory approvals for innovative DEBs and clinical studies demonstrating their efficacy and safety continue to propel growth, while increasing awareness among healthcare professionals about the benefits of DEBs over conventional approaches fosters their adoption.</p></p>
